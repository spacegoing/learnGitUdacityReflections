How often to commit?

    Make one commit per logical change. Each change is logically separated.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit?

    If one file is commited,  Git will save all files in the same repository.
    git log --stat
    This command can see which files are changed. How many lines are added or
    removed.

Useful Git Commands:

       Git Clone:
       	   git clone url: will clone the entire directory to local disk.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
